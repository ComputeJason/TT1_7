# MiniPostman Intro

#### **Hello this is meant to be a mini template to kick-start small project developments.** 
#### **Boilerplate codes have been set up for both FE (React) and BE (Express) and have integrated endpoints for you to use as examples when you start!** 
##### How to start respective apps are explained in the FE & BE folders ReadMe

** mainly meant to test the APIs you created in the BE, however, can be used to test public APIs as well. 

## Main MiniPostman Feature 

Only supports GET & POST requests! Toggle between them with the toggle bar and enter the endpoint in the Textfield. Test your APIs as you build and how they look in the FE!
